Library in Babel
================
LiB is generative software to create books for Borges' infinite Library in Babel. It is a manifestation of the total library, posited by Jorge Luis Borges, that contains all possible books in the world. LiB contains all known books and allows for more to be "discovered" (through generative creation) and added to the collection.

Note: This is just starter code. Does not contain any of the programs/stories or starter books.

A long term goal would be to turn this into a web-based application that enables collaboration.
This could also be turned into a pseudo-operating system program that allows a variety of stories from Ficciones to be run like programs, as in TempleOS.
